Install & usage:

To compile the code:
1) install cmake, boost and ITK libraries on your machine
2) For in-source build, in current directory, run: ccmake ./
3) 'c' to configue and 'g' to generate makefile.
4) make

After step 4, just type ./activeCutSeg youâ€™ll see all the input parameters needed.

Example:
../activeCutSeg -d ../allchannels.nii.gz -p ../mask.nii.gz --init ../userInitializationBoundingBox.nii.gz -m 10 --priorfg ../priorfg.nii.gz --priorbg ../prior.nii.gz --eta 4 -g 6 --qscoreth 3.0

Recommended modules:
activeCutSeg takes a 4D image as input. The various channels of images can be 
merged into one single 4D image by using some other tools (such as
convertITKformat). It is conceptually easy for activeCutSeg to use 4D image
input. The output will be 4D images, too.

Before doing any testing, please install a software (Slicer or ITK-SNAP) to visually 
check the candidate objects for user interaction.
